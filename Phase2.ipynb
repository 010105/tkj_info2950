    "What factors affect if a U.S domestic flight will be delayed or cancelled? Which flights are most likely to be delayed or cancelled? How much time will each flight be delayed? Are there airlines that are better than others in terms of number of delays and delay times? Can flight history be used to predict the delay time of future flights?\n",

    "In this assignment we will see if we can use our data from 2022, about if a flight has been delayed or not and the various factors affecting it. We will use values such as various values such as Cancelled, Diverted, Month, Operating Airline, Distance and originState and many more to see if we can predict if a flight will be delayed or cancelled, and possibly by how much."

    "__For what purpose was the dataset created?__\n",
    "- Flight delays are something most of us who have traveled by air have experienced. Regardless of the reason for delays, they pose a huge inconvenience for travelers. These datasets were created so that relevant analysis can be done on the vast amount of data available on flight travel. This would help generate valuable insight into the cause and effect of flight delays. Gaining insight into this would help airline companies, airports, and passengers. \n",
    "- The dataset on the list of US airports with geolocation coordinates was created by Aravind Ram Nathan on Kaggle to make plotting on map analysis easier for researchers. \n",
    "- National Weather Service (NWS) dataset was created to allow developers access to critical forecasts and weather data and promote machine data discovery. This data is from a governmental agency to make data available for public knowledge and use. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Who funded the creation of the dataset?__\n",
    "- It is unclear who funded the creation of the Flight Status Prediction Dataset, but the data has been extracted from the Marketing Carrier On-Time Performance (Beginning January 2018) data table of the \"On-Time\" database from the TranStats data library. The weather data from the National Weather Service is funded by the United States Government. It is unclear where the data on the List of US airports has been extracted from, but the owner of the dataset on kaggle is Aravind Ram Nathan. \n"
